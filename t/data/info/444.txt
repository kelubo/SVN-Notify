There are a number of things to try. First, we have an email address,
recipient@example.com. The period should not be a part of the link.
Next, we have a URL: http://www.kineticode.com/! The exclamation point
(or full stop) should not be a part of the link, either. We can also
have complex URLs, like http://www.example.com/my.pl?one=1&two=2&f=w**t.
Again, the period should not be a part of the link.

We might have a few RT links, too. For example, If I mention Ticket # 6,
it will be a link. Likewise, if I decide to, I can  go ahead with Ticket
12, where I have no # and the string is divided over two lines. But
sticket 69 won't match. Jesse also wants RT-Ticket: #23 to work and Ask
wants RT #45 to work.

Of course, we have our mainstay, ViewCVS, which will refer to SVN numbers
such as Revision 6000. And just like the others, we can make it rev
6001. It's not only divided over two lines, but the "ivision" part is
optional! But not grev 200, because there is no word boundary.

Next there's Bugzilla. We just say Bug # 1234 or bug 8, but not humbug 3.
Again, we can go ahead and push this puppy to the limits, and write Bug
#4321, where we again have the string split over two lines.

And then we have JIRA links. Here I just say TST1234-111. But JIRA-
4321 won't match, because it needs to be a single string. Likewise,
a string with studlyCAPS-1234 won't match.

Next up, a custom ticket number, here [Custom # 54321]. Nice, eh?

And finally, for the diff, there is a modified file, a modified file
with a property set, a file with just a property set, a deleted file,
and an added file.

Oh, and did I mention that we need to properly support “Unicode characters”?

Enjoy!
