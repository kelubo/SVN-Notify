Hrm hrm. Let's try a few links. First, there's an email address,
foo@example.com. Then there is a URL, http://www.kineticode.com/.
Try a fancy URL, such as http://foo.bar.com/one/two/do.pl?this=1&that=2.

We should also try a few links to other applications. First, we have
A Bugzilla Bug # 709. Then we have a JIRA key, PRJ1234-111. And
finally, we have an RT link to Ticket # 4321. Oh, and don't forget
the GNATS key, PR 12345, and the custom ticket, [Custom # 4321]!

Hey, we could add one for a Subversion Revision # 606, too!

And finally, we have RT-Ticket: 123 for Jesse and RT # 445 for Ask.
And we even have Mantis-161: foo bar baz for Dirk Olmes.
